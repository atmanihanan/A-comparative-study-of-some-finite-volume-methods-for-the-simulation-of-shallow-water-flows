In this project, we examine and compare various finite volume methods for simulating
shallow water flows. Our study focuses on several key areas, beginning with the anal-
ysis of the Riemann problem in both scalar cases and linear PDE systems. We then
explore the fundamental properties of finite volume schemes, including consistency and
the conservative property, with particular emphasis on specific schemes such as Godunov,
Harten-Lax-van Leer, and Roe. Additionally, we address TVD (Total Variation Dimin-
ishing) schemes to ensure the stability and accuracy of numerical solutions. We also apply
these methods to the one-dimensional transport equation and Burgersâ€™ equation, using
both the method of characteristics and finite volume schemes like HLL and Roe. The
extension of these schemes to second-order spatial accuracy is also discussed. Finally,
we model shallow water flows using the Saint-Venant equations, simulating phenomena
such as dam breaks under various conditions. This project provides a detailed compar-
ative analysis of finite volume methods, highlighting their advantages and limitations,
and offering valuable insights for selecting appropriate numerical schemes for specific
applications in fluid dynamics.
